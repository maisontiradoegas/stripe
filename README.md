# Plan: Do Method 1 & 2 Tonight. 

Method 1: Use Stripe Checkout Service to add a Pay Button for Each Product. 
This button will be placed on different Product Pages in the Html and connect. (DONE) I just need the route from (Matt)*

Method 2: Use Old Checkout Service and place button on each Product Page and Hard -Code Description and Price with info for each Product. (Have a few errors)* 

Method 3: Use Stripe Elements to create a checkout process that takes input from a users form (which product) to populate  the amount needed to be paid. 

Method 4: Use Existing Codebase Matt sent and make a custom checkout Process. 
Added functionality needs to be coded.
